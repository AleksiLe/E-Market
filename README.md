# E-Market
Web marketplace with its own mobile app, website  and backend.
Currently hosted in AWS (Only web front, I migrate API and DB later), as Azure won't keep my free tier services up.

### About the mobile app
I will probably release the App bundle here on GitHub as 
it's currently in internal testing on Google Play.
I just wanted to let you know that I won't move forward 
from there as it's only a free-time mock project. 
I will still improve it and add users to the application.
